# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component

![Design preview for the Results summary component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.  

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.  

We provide the data for the results in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to add the results and total score dynamically if you choose.  

Your users should be able to:  

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size  
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page  
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content  

## Layout

The designs were created to the following widths:  

- Mobile: 375px  
- Desktop: 1440px  

> ðŸ’¡ These are just the design sizes. Ensure content is responsive and meets WCAG requirements by testing the full range of screen sizes from 320px to large screens.
